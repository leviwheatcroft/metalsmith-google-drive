[metalsmith](metalsmith.io) to scrape files from google drive

Highlights:

 * requests token authorisation via CLI
 * caches token and files, only requests changed files
 * no tests yet
 * Take a look at the [annotated source][1]

## install

sorry not published to npm just yet...

`npm i --save github:leviwheatcroft/metalsmith-google-drive`

## usage

### api credentials

Follow [this guide][2], go through A to G under *Step 1*, the downloaded file
will contain the credentials you need to pass into this plugin. In these
examples I'm using [config][3] to store them.

### example

```javascript
Metalsmith('src')
.use(googleDrive({
  auth: config.get('driveAuth'),
  src: '0B1QpLgu4qk48R1hDBi1wWFkyV2s',
  dest: 'articles'
}))
.build( ... )
```

### options

Options object must contain:

 * `src` being the drive id of the parent folder you want to scrape
 * `dest` the path under which you want to place the scraped files in metalsmith
 * `auth` object containing `client_id`, `client_secret` and `redirect_uris`

### notes

 * to get a google drive folder id just view it in your browser and copy the id
   from the url
 * files in subfolders on google drive will be included, but their containing
   folders will not be included in the path in metalsmith. In otherwords, this
   plugin does a recursive search but flattens the result.
 * files scraped from drive will not be stored in your source folder, they're
   added directly to metalsmith `files` structure during build.

## node 4 LTS

`var drive = require('metalsmith-google-drive/dist/node4')`
